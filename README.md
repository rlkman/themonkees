# The Monkees Band

I have been contracted to buid a website for the Monkees, a 1960’s rock band who have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. I have been provided with the following requirements by their representatives:
Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.

I am going to use a mobile first design process, and use Bootstrap for my basic design and time permitting will jazz it up later. I will utilise my UX design process to focus my design for user enjoyability and make sure my clients are happy and will get bookings for events they can perform at.

 
## UX
 
In designing the website I relyed heavily on Jesse James Garrett's defined UX process. I focused on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how my project provides the best way to help them achieve these objectives.

### Strategy - The Aim (Definition and Value?)
#### User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
-My name is John (male, 53yrs old), I am an avid Rocker from the 60's and still enjoy listening to this music. I have recently found it difficult to locate venues for shows around here (Minisotta). It would be nice if The Monkees could have their own website where such infomation as show dates and any new materials they are doing at the moment could be availed.

- Hi, Im Jessie (female, 32yrs old) and grew up listening to all these old tunes with my Dad. Thats how I beame a Monkees fan. Since leaving home I have found it difficult to find their music online and even shows they are having are not carried by the mainstream sites. 

- I am a forty year old female nurse who enjoyed watching The Monkees on TV when weekend music shows were the in thing then. I loved the group and their mellow rock tunes. I was hooked. Since loosing my vinly collection I have found it difficult to replace my albums. Would really appreciate having an online place where I could follow the Band. Oh, my name is Judy.

### Scope - Whats on the plate (Functional Specs and Content Reqs)
#### Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Structure - Patterns and Sequencies (Information Architecture)



### Skeleton - Nav and Visual Presentation (Interface Design)
#### Wireframes, mockups, diagrams
The design process included creating wireframes, mockups and diagrams. These files can be viewed in the assets/planning directory.


### Surface - The 'Project' (The UI is the System)





 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

In this project, you’ll be building a frontend-only website using the technologies that you have learned throughout User Centric Frontend Development. You can either choose to use the example brief below or choose to use your idea for the website.

CREATE A WEBSITE FOR A BAND
Build a static (front-end only) website for a band. As a starting point, you may want to use wireframes, 
as we did in the UX lesson (you can use Balsamiq or any other tool, including just pen and paper). You 
can use either your assets or the assets within the following GitHub repo.
The band is a 1960’s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events 
around the world. You have been given the following requirements after interviews with the client’s representatives:
Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.
The band has provided you, the developer, with the following assets that they would like to showcase on their website:
Photos of the band members
A video clip
Audio clips
Also, they are in the process of creating a social media presence and would like to add links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages.

Use the following guidelines when developing your project:

Create a website of around 4-5 pages, or (if using a single scrolling page) these should be separate page areas.
Incorporate main navigation and grid layout (you might want to use Flexbox or Bootstrap to accomplish this).
Whenever possible, strive to use semantic HTML5 elements to structure your HTML code better.
Make sure your site is as responsive as possible. You can test this by checking the website on different screen sizes and browsers.
We advise that you write down user stories and create wireframes/mockups before embarking on full-blown development.
The site can also make use of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, just make sure you maintain a clear separation between the library code and your code.
You should conduct and document tests to ensure that all of your website’s functionality works well.
Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the need that it fulfills. It should also describe the functionality of the project, as well as the technologies used. Detail how the project was deployed and tested and if some of the work was based on other code, explain what was kept and how it was changed to fit your need. A project submitted without a README.md file will FAIL.
Use Git & GitHub for version control. Each new piece of functionality should be in a separate commit.
Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.

PLAGIARISM
It is each student’s responsibility to ensure that when they include (directly or indirectly) the work of others that this contribution is fully and adequately acknowledged and documented.
