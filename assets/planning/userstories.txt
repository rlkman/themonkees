My name is John (male, 53yrs old), I am an avid Rocker from the 60's and still enjoy listening to this music. I have recently found it difficult to locate venues for shows around here (Minisotta). It would be nice if The Monkees could have their own website where such infomation as show dates and any new materials they are doing at the moment could be availed.

Hi, Im Jessie (female, 32yrs old) and grew up listening to all these old tunes with my Dad. Thats how I beame a Monkees fan. Since leaving home I have found it difficult to find their music online and even shows they are having are not carried by the mainstream sites. 

I am a forty year old female nurse who enjoyed watching The Monkees on TV when weekend music shows were the in thing then. I loved the group and their mellow rock tunes. I was hooked. Since loosing my vinly collection I have found it difficult to replace my albums. Would really appreciate having an online place where I could follow the Band. Oh, my name is Judy.

The Monkees "Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available. Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties."
